# Deferred endpoints and signed complex transfer

This package integrates Swapnil Jain's pinned round7 bit network and round6
complex network with main's balanced semantic assembly, yielding the conditional
certificate **κ=63965813/10^12 > 2^-14**. See [PROOF.md](PROOF.md) for the
complete changed-interface argument and inherited assumptions. This package
does not replace the repository's maintainer-reviewed release.

New work by Zhihao Chen (jacklightChen), with Codex assistance, supplies explicit
reflected schedules, a commuting fan-order clarification, nonzero auxiliary
endpoint accounting, signed complex phase correction, and the enlarged semantic
and row-stock bridge. The original source and all author/license/AI disclosures
remain under `swapnil-round7/`; predecessor credit is detailed in the proof.
Future research using these specific additions should acknowledge Zhihao Chen.
Historical GPT-6 Astra assistance remains attributed to the earlier contributions;
no current runtime model or global-first claim is made.

Swapnil's preserved source reports a slightly larger final value under its own
analytic stack. Our contribution is the explicit interface audit and integration
with the retained main assumptions, not a claim to surpass that reported value.
Previously explored local terminal-sharing/minimal-frame gains are not added
to this package without recompilation.

From the repository root:

```sh
make deferred-signed-verify
python3 research/deferred-signed/verify.py --replay-own
python3 research/deferred-signed/verify.py --replay
make verify
```

The first command checks all source pins, the exact moments, saved finite
evidence and independently regenerates the complete assembly. `--replay-own`
reconstructs both literal ledgers and the exact tensor/signed controls;
`--replay` additionally runs the original finite bit geometry and staircase
checks. Replay uses temporary directories and leaves frozen evidence intact.
The rational tensor control requires SymPy; the other new drivers use the
standard library. CI installs the pinned dependency for replay.

The validation-prior directory preserves the original executed audit sources
and structured native receipts. Four historical replay log files are excluded
by the root .gitignore rule for log files; their SHA-256 values remain recorded in
SOURCE.json under ignored_log_sha256, but the raw log contents are not shipped
or required by the replay. The portability checker permits only two documented
path substitutions; it does not silently treat different mathematical code as
already-passed check. Machine elapsed times are excluded from regenerated
mathematical-output comparisons. The `new_multiplication_bound: false` fields
in these historical receipts accurately record their scope when run; the
conditional integration argument is supplied separately by this package.

The common rational bit basis is established by nonvanishing polynomial
witnesses on a finite irreducible family, not by pretending sampled modular
pairs are an enumeration. Complex dirty restoration follows the exact h24
support identity and invertible commutator argument, with full small controls
and a full h24 physical event/frame ledger. There is no dense h24 coefficient
matrix replay and no claim that finite tests formalize the entire theorem.
